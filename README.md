For this practice, you will be making some tests to find some issues with my code!

Fork my project and clone it to your local machine
Take some time (15 minutes) to familiarize yourself with the code that I have written.  Make sure to read the comments to figure out what each method is meant to do.
Come up with some simple tests and find errors, oversights, or bugs in my code!

Questions to guide your testing:
  What types of input will cause a problem in my method?
  Does the method handle invalid input appropriately?
  Does the method throw a descriptive error upon invalid input?
  Upon valid input, does the method work as expected (i.e. does the method produce the expected result)?
